Notes made while reading Secrets of the JS Ninja
================================

A test program that lets me view and load JS files.

As I am reading through the book, I'm able to build sample files for each section.



What?
------------------------------------------------------------
These are snippets / notes from the book that I made / used to learn the techniques from John Resig and Bear Bibeault's <a href="http://jsninja.com">Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a>. 


Why?
------------------------------------------------------------
For fun and profit. Mainly because I was out of stuff to do...
